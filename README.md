# aDNA_imputation

In this repository, you can find the scripts we made to impute ancient genomes in the study "Imputation of ancient genomes", available on bioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.19.500636). We include all the pre-processing steps (e.g., downsampling and genotype calling), as well as post-imputation filtering (genotype probability and minor allele frequency (MAF)).
